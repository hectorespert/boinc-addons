[BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu) is an open-source software platform for computing using volunteered resources.

The BOINC add-on, running on your Home Assistant, downloads scientific computing jobs and runs them invisibly in the background.

## ⚠️ Important

**This add-on requires Protection Mode to be disabled** to monitor system-wide CPU usage and automatically suspend computations when other services need resources.
